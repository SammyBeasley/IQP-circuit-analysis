# IQP-circuit-analysis
The purpose of this project is to see if the distributions generated by IQP (Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial-time) circuits can be used to uncover underlying graph structure that generated them.
This project particularly focuses on connected graphs.

## Features
- Generate IQP circuits for connected graphs with n nodes
- Compute and store probability distributions over bitstrings
- Analyze results (Hamming weight and multiplicities, TVD, etc.)

## Stored data
- The file IQP distributions for n nodes is pre loaded with the distribution values for theta in [0,pi/2] for n in [4,7]
- The file n node connected graphs is pre loaded with the non isomorphic connected n node network x graphs for n in [4,7]
- The file n node similarity data is pre loaded with the tvd (total variation distance) values for each graph in connected_graphs_n for n in [5,6]

## Installation

### Using conda
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate quantum_env
