# IQP-circuit-analysis
The purpose of this project is to see if the distributions generated by IQP (Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial-time) circuits can be used to uncover underlying graph structure that generated them.
This project particularly focuses on connected graphs.

## Features
- Generate IQP circuits for connected graphs with n nodes
- Compute and store probability distributions over bitstrings
- Analyze results (Hamming weight and multiplicities, TVD, etc.)
